# photobooth ᡣ𐭩 •｡ꪆৎ ˚

This project is a gift for my friend, who is obssessed with both taking photos and haikyuu characters. The goal is to create an application that accesses the device camera, allowing users to select how many pictures they want, and peice the final images into photobooth printout, with border options.
